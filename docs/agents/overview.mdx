# Agents Overview

Agents in the Quran AI system are specialized AI components that perform complex reasoning tasks, maintain context, and provide personalized interactions. They form the reasoning layer of our architecture, building upon the foundation layer of tools.

## What Are Agents?

In our system, agents are:

- **Reasoning-focused**: Agents perform multi-step reasoning to solve complex problems
- **Stateful**: Agents maintain conversation context and user preferences
- **Adaptive**: Agents adjust their approach based on user needs and feedback
- **Specialized**: Each agent focuses on a specific domain or type of interaction
- **Tool-using**: Agents leverage tools to access information and perform actions

## When to Use Agents

Agents are ideal for:

1. **Complex Reasoning**: Tasks requiring multiple steps of thought or analysis
2. **Personalized Guidance**: Providing tailored spiritual or educational guidance
3. **Domain Expertise**: Offering specialized knowledge in specific areas
4. **Contextual Conversations**: Maintaining coherent, context-aware dialogues
5. **Multi-step Processes**: Guiding users through sequential activities

## Agent Categories

Our agents are organized into the following categories:

### 1. Knowledge and Interpretation Agents

Agents focused on understanding and explaining Quranic knowledge:

- **TafsirAgent**: Provides scholarly interpretations with nuanced understanding
- **ComparativeAnalysisAgent**: Compares different interpretations or translations
- **ContextualUnderstandingAgent**: Explains historical and textual context
- **LinguisticAnalysisAgent**: Analyzes linguistic features and nuances

### 2. Personal Guidance Agents

Agents focused on applying Quranic wisdom to personal situations:

- **SpiritualGuidanceAgent**: Offers spiritual advice based on Quranic principles
- **LifeApplicationAgent**: Helps apply Quranic teachings to daily life
- **ReflectionAgent**: Guides personal reflection on Quranic themes
- **EthicalDecisionAgent**: Assists with ethical questions from a Quranic perspective

### 3. Educational Agents

Agents focused on teaching and learning:

- **QuranTeacherAgent**: Provides structured learning about the Quran
- **StorytellerAgent**: Narrates Quranic stories with educational insights
- **QuizAgent**: Creates and administers quizzes on Quranic knowledge
- **StudyPlanAgent**: Develops personalized Quranic study plans

### 4. Creative Expression Agents

Agents focused on artistic and creative expressions:

- **PoetryAgent**: Creates or analyzes poetry inspired by Quranic themes
- **VisualizationAgent**: Designs visual representations of Quranic concepts
- **MetaphorAgent**: Explains and explores Quranic metaphors
- **AestheticAgent**: Provides aesthetic interpretations of Quranic beauty

### 5. Meta Agents

Agents that coordinate other agents and manage the overall experience:

- **OrchestratorAgent**: Coordinates multiple agents to fulfill user requests
- **PersonalizationAgent**: Maintains user preferences and adapts experiences
- **EthicalOversightAgent**: Ensures responses align with Islamic ethics
- **FeedbackAgent**: Collects and processes user feedback to improve the system

## Agent Capabilities

Each agent has the following core capabilities:

### 1. Multi-step Reasoning

Agents can perform complex reasoning processes:

- Breaking down problems into sub-problems
- Considering multiple perspectives or approaches
- Evaluating evidence and drawing conclusions
- Explaining reasoning steps when appropriate

### 2. Tool Utilization

Agents can use tools to extend their capabilities:

- Selecting appropriate tools based on the task
- Providing correct parameters to tools
- Interpreting tool outputs
- Combining multiple tool calls for complex tasks

### 3. Context Management

Agents maintain conversation context:

- Remembering previous interactions
- Building on established knowledge
- Recognizing recurring themes or questions
- Adapting to shifts in conversation

### 4. Personalization

Agents adapt to individual users:

- Learning user preferences and knowledge level
- Adjusting tone and complexity
- Remembering personal details when relevant
- Providing consistent experiences across sessions

## Agent Development Guidelines

When developing new agents, follow these guidelines:

1. **Clear Purpose**: Define the agent's specific domain and objectives
2. **Reasoning Transparency**: Ensure the agent can explain its reasoning
3. **Tool Integration**: Identify which tools the agent should use
4. **Ethical Boundaries**: Define clear ethical guidelines for the agent
5. **Evaluation Metrics**: Establish how to measure the agent's effectiveness
6. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Create graceful fallbacks for when the agent is uncertain
