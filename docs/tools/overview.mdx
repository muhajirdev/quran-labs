# Tools Overview

Tools in the Quran AI system are specialized components that perform specific, well-defined tasks with high reliability and efficiency. They form the foundation layer of our architecture, providing essential capabilities that both users and agents can leverage.

## What Are Tools?

In our system, tools are:

- **Specialized**: Each tool performs a specific function
- **Stateless**: Tools don't maintain their own conversation state
- **Composable**: Tools can be combined to perform complex operations
- **Deterministic**: Given the same input, a tool will produce the same output
- **Efficient**: Tools are optimized for performance and resource usage

## When to Use Tools

Tools are ideal for:

1. **Information Retrieval**: Fetching specific data from databases or APIs
2. **Content Transformation**: Converting between formats or languages
3. **Media Generation**: Creating images, audio, or other media
4. **Structured Analysis**: Performing well-defined analytical tasks
5. **External System Integration**: Connecting with databases or services

## Tool Categories

Our tools are organized into the following categories:

### 1. Knowledge Access Tools

Tools for accessing and retrieving information from our knowledge bases:

- **VerseRetriever**: Fetch Quranic verses by reference, keyword, or theme
- **TafsirRetriever**: Access scholarly interpretations of verses
- **HadithRetriever**: Find relevant hadith related to Quranic concepts
- **ScholarlyOpinionRetriever**: Access views from different scholars and schools of thought

### 2. Language Processing Tools

Tools for working with text in various languages:

- **ArabicTransliterator**: Convert between Arabic script and Latin characters
- **VerseTranslator**: Provide translations of verses in multiple languages
- **RootWordAnalyzer**: Analyze Arabic words for their trilateral roots
- **LinguisticFeatureExtractor**: Identify linguistic features in Quranic Arabic

### 3. Semantic Analysis Tools

Tools for understanding meaning and relationships:

- **ConceptExtractor**: Identify key concepts in text
- **ThematicAnalyzer**: Recognize themes in verses or passages
- **SemanticSearcher**: Find semantically related content
- **RelationshipMapper**: Map relationships between concepts, verses, or chapters

### 4. Media Generation Tools

Tools for creating visual and audio content:

- **CalligraphyGenerator**: Create Arabic calligraphy of verses
- **VisualizationCreator**: Generate charts, graphs, or other visualizations
- **AudioRecitationProvider**: Provide audio recitations of verses
- **WallpaperGenerator**: Create beautiful wallpapers featuring verses or concepts

### 5. Graph Database Tools

Tools for interacting with our Kuzu graph database:

- **GraphQueryExecutor**: Execute Cypher queries against the graph database
- **PathFinder**: Find paths between concepts or verses in the knowledge graph
- **SubgraphExtractor**: Extract relevant subgraphs for specific topics
- **GraphVisualizer**: Create visual representations of graph structures

## Tool Integration

Tools can be integrated into the system in several ways:

1. **Direct API Access**: Tools can be called directly via API endpoints
2. **Agent Utilization**: Agents can use tools to perform specific tasks
3. **Chained Operations**: Multiple tools can be chained together for complex workflows
4. **User Interface Integration**: Tools can be exposed directly in the UI for user interaction

## Tool Development Guidelines

When developing new tools, follow these guidelines:

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each tool should do one thing well
2. **Clear Interface**: Define clear inputs and outputs
3. **Error Handling**: Provide meaningful error messages
4. **Performance**: Optimize for speed and resource efficiency
5. **Documentation**: Document purpose, inputs, outputs, and examples
6. **Testing**: Create comprehensive tests for each tool
