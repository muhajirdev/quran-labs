# Searching the Quran with Quran AI

## Types of Searches

Quran AI supports several types of searches to help you find what you're looking for:

### Natural Language Questions

You can ask questions in everyday language, just as you would ask a knowledgeable friend:

- "What does the Quran say about being kind to parents?"
- "How should I deal with anxiety according to Islamic teachings?"
- "What are the qualities of believers mentioned in the Quran?"

- "2:255" (Surah Al-Baqarah, verse 255 - Ayatul Kursi)
- "Surah Yasin verse 36"
- "Al-Fatiha 1-7"

### Keyword Search

You can search for specific words or phrases:

- "mercy"
- "straight path"
- "day of judgment"

### Thematic Search

You can search for broader themes and topics:

- "Stories of the prophets"
- "Verses about patience"
- "Guidance for difficult times"

## Search Tips

### Be Specific

The more specific your question, the more targeted the results will be:

- Instead of: "What does the Quran say about prayer?"
- Try: "What does the Quran say about the importance of praying on time?"

### Consider Context

Mention your context to get more relevant results:

- "What does the Quran say about raising children?"
- "How can I be patient as a parent according to the Quran?"
- "Quranic guidance for business ethics"

### Explore Related Concepts

If you don't find what you're looking for with one search, try related concepts:

- If searching for "happiness" doesn't yield enough results, try "contentment," "joy," or "satisfaction"
- If searching for "leadership" doesn't work well, try "guidance," "authority," or "responsibility"

### Use Arabic Terms When Relevant

For concepts that have specific Islamic terminology, including the Arabic term can help:

- "Taqwa" (God-consciousness)
- "Sabr" (patience)
- "Rizq" (provision)
