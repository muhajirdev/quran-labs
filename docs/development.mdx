# Development Guide

This guide will help you set up your development environment for contributing to the Quran Knowledge Graph project. Whether you're interested in improving the core functionality, adding new features, or fixing bugs, this guide will get you started.

## Development Environment Setup

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

First, fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quran-knowledge-graph.git
cd quran-knowledge-graph
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment for development:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Development Dependencies

Install all dependencies, including development tools:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # If available
```

### 4. Set Up Pre-commit Hooks

We use pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

## Project Structure

Understanding the project structure will help you navigate and contribute effectively:

```
quran-knowledge-graph/
├── docs/                  # Documentation
├── quran_graph/           # Main package
│   ├── scripts/           # Utility scripts
│   ├── models/            # Data models
│   └── db/                # Database utilities
├── data/                  # Data files
├── tests/                 # Test suite
├── .gitignore             # Git ignore file
├── requirements.txt       # Dependencies
└── README.md              # Project overview
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a New Branch

Always create a new branch for your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

Implement your changes, following these guidelines:

- Follow the existing code style
- Write tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Keep commits focused and atomic

### 3. Run Tests

Make sure all tests pass before submitting your changes:

```bash
pytest
```

### 4. Submit a Pull Request

Once your changes are ready:

1. Push your branch to your fork
2. Create a pull request from your fork to the main repository
3. Describe your changes in detail
4. Reference any related issues

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We follow PEP 8 for Python code style. Use tools like `black` and `flake8` to ensure your code meets these standards:

```bash
# Format code
black quran_graph/

# Check for style issues
flake8 quran_graph/
```

### Documentation

All new features should be documented:

- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Update the relevant documentation files in the `docs/` directory
- Include examples where appropriate

### Testing

We use pytest for testing:

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request
- Aim for good test coverage

## Working with the Database

### Local Development Database

For development, you can create a smaller test database:

```bash
python -m quran_graph.scripts.init_test_db
```

This creates a smaller database with a subset of the data, which is faster to set up and work with during development.

### Schema Changes

If you need to make changes to the database schema:

1. Update the schema definition in `quran_graph/db/schema.py`
2. Create a migration script in `quran_graph/scripts/migrations/`
3. Test the migration thoroughly
4. Document the changes

## Documentation Development

We use Mintlify for our documentation. To preview documentation changes locally:

1. Install the Mintlify CLI:
   ```bash
   npm i -g mintlify
   ```

2. Run the documentation locally:
   ```bash
   mintlify dev
   ```

3. View the documentation at `http://localhost:3000`

## Getting Help

If you need help with development:

- Check the existing documentation
- Look at the issue tracker for similar issues
- Join our community discussions
- Reach out to the maintainers

We appreciate your contributions to the Quran Knowledge Graph project!
