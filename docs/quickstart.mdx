# Quickstart Guide

This guide will help you get started with the Quran Knowledge Graph quickly. You'll learn how to install the necessary dependencies, set up the database, and run your first queries.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muhajirdev/quran-labs.git
cd quran-knowledge-graph
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the necessary packages, including:
- Kuzu (graph database)
- Pandas and NumPy (data processing)
- Transformers and PyTorch (for embeddings)
- Other utilities and visualization libraries

## Setting Up the Database

### 1. Initialize the Database

```bash
python -m quran_graph.scripts.init_db
```

This script will:
- Create the database directory
- Define the schema (nodes and relationships)
- Set up indices for efficient queries

### 2. Import Data

```bash
python -m quran_graph.scripts.import_data
```

This script will:
- Download data from qul.tarteel.ai (if not already present)
- Process and transform the data
- Import it into the Kuzu graph database
- Generate embeddings for verses, words, and topics

<Note>
  The data import process may take some time, especially the embedding generation step.
</Note>

## Running Your First Queries

Now that you have the database set up, you can start running queries. Here's a simple example to get you started:

```python
from quran_graph.scripts.query_utils import QuranGraphQuery

# Initialize the query utility
query = QuranGraphQuery()

# Get information about the first chapter (Al-Fatiha)
chapters = query.get_chapters(limit=1)
print(chapters)

# Get verses from the first chapter
verses = query.get_verses_by_chapter(1)
print(verses)

# Perform a semantic search
results = query.semantic_search("mercy and forgiveness")
print(results)
```
