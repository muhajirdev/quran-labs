# Example Queries

This section provides practical query examples demonstrating the power and flexibility of the Quran Knowledge Graph for various analytical tasks.

## Overview

The Quran Knowledge Graph enables powerful queries using OpenCypher, the query language supported by Kuzu and other graph databases. These queries demonstrate how to extract insights, discover patterns, and explore relationships within the Quranic text.

## Query Categories

The example queries are organized into the following categories:

1. **[Basic Queries](basic_queries.md)**: Fundamental queries for retrieving and filtering data
2. **[Thematic Queries](thematic_queries.md)**: Queries focused on thematic exploration and analysis
3. **[Linguistic Queries](linguistic_queries.md)**: Queries for analyzing linguistic features and patterns
4. **[Rhetorical and Linguistic Queries](rhetorical_linguistic_queries.md)**: Queries for analyzing rhetorical devices and linguistic patterns inspired by scholarly approaches
5. **[Semantic Queries](semantic_queries.md)**: Queries leveraging vector embeddings for semantic search
6. **[Advanced Analytical Queries](advanced_queries.md)**: Complex queries for sophisticated analysis

## Using These Examples

Each query example includes:

- A description of what the query accomplishes
- The complete OpenCypher query code
- An explanation of the parameters and their values
- A description of the expected results
- Potential variations or extensions

These examples can be:
- Used directly in your Quran Knowledge Graph implementation
- Modified to suit your specific needs
- Combined to create more complex analytical workflows
- Used as inspiration for developing your own queries

## Query Optimization

When implementing these queries, consider the following optimization tips:

- Create appropriate indices for frequently queried properties
- Use parameters rather than hardcoding values
- Limit result sets to a reasonable size
- Consider query execution plans for complex queries
- Cache frequently used query results

## Next Steps

After exploring these example queries, consider how they can be integrated into the [Products and Use Cases](../products/README.md) described in the previous section.
