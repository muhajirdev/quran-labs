## General Questions

### What is the Quran Knowledge Graph?

The Quran Knowledge Graph is a comprehensive database that represents the Quran as an interconnected network of verses, words, concepts, and scholarly interpretations. It enables powerful search, exploration, and analysis of the Quranic text and related knowledge.

### What is Quran AI?

Quran AI is a user-friendly application built on top of the Quran Knowledge Graph. It helps Muslims explore, reflect on, and act upon the Quran through the lens of their life context—whether as a parent, student, professional, or seeker. Using AI, vector search, and rich semantic graphs, it connects personal queries to authentic verses, tafsir, and reflection pathways.

### Is this meant to replace traditional Quran study?

No, absolutely not. Quran AI and the Quran Knowledge Graph are tools to complement traditional Quran study, not replace it. They are designed to help users discover relevant verses and interpretations, but deep understanding still comes from dedicated study, reflection, and guidance from knowledgeable teachers.

### How accurate is the information?

We prioritize accuracy and authenticity in all our data. The Quranic text comes from verified sources, and all tafsir (interpretations) are from recognized scholarly works. The AI components are trained to provide information based on these authentic sources, not to generate new interpretations.

## Using Quran AI

### How do I ask questions about the Quran?

You can ask questions in natural language, just as you would ask a knowledgeable friend. For example:
- "What does the Quran say about patience during hardship?"
- "How should I deal with anger according to Islamic teachings?"
- "What verses talk about the importance of knowledge?"

### Can I search for specific verses?

Yes, you can search by:
- Surah and verse number (e.g., "2:255" for Ayatul Kursi)
- Keywords or phrases
- Themes or topics
- Questions about content

### What languages are supported?

Currently, we support English and Arabic, with plans to add more languages in the future.

### How does the AI generate responses?

The AI uses a combination of:
1. Graph database queries to find relevant verses and relationships
2. Vector similarity search to find semantically related content
3. Natural language processing to understand your questions
4. Structured knowledge from authentic Islamic sources

The system does not "make up" answers but retrieves and synthesizes information from verified sources.

## Technical Questions

### What technologies power the Quran Knowledge Graph?

The Quran Knowledge Graph uses:
- Kuzu graph database for storing relationships
- Vector embeddings for semantic search
- Natural language processing for query understanding
- Web technologies for the user interface

### Can I contribute to the project?

Yes! We welcome contributions from developers, Islamic scholars, linguists, and anyone passionate about making the Quran more accessible. See our [Contributing Guide](/developers/contributing) for more information.

### Is the data available for research?

Yes, we provide access to the Quran Knowledge Graph data for research purposes. Please contact us with details about your research project to discuss access options.

### How can I integrate with the API?

We offer API access for developers who want to build applications on top of the Quran Knowledge Graph. See our [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction) for documentation and [Getting Started for Developers](/developers/getting-started) for integration guides.

## Data and Privacy

### How is my data used?

We only collect anonymous usage data to improve the service. Your questions and interactions help us understand what topics are most important to users and how we can improve the accuracy and relevance of responses.

### Are my searches private?

Yes, your searches are private. We do not associate them with your identity or share them with third parties.

### What data sources are used?

Our primary sources include:
- The Quranic text in its original Arabic
- Multiple verified translations
- Classical and contemporary tafsir (interpretations)
- Hadith collections (sayings of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ)
- Scholarly works on Quranic themes and linguistics
