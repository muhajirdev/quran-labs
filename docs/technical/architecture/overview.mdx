# Architecture Overview

The Quran Knowledge Graph is built on a hybrid architecture that combines graph database technology with vector embeddings to enable both structured relationship queries and semantic similarity search.

## System Architecture

The system architecture consists of several key components:

### Core Components

1. **Graph Database (Kuzu)** - Stores the structured relationships between Quranic entities
2. **Vector Database** - Stores embeddings for semantic search capabilities
3. **API Layer** - Provides unified access to both graph and vector capabilities
4. **Application Layer** - User-facing interfaces and applications

## Data Flow

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Quranic text and metadata from various sources
   - Tafsir and scholarly commentary
   - Pre-computed relationships and annotations

2. **Processing Pipeline**
   - Text normalization and cleaning
   - Entity extraction and relationship mapping
   - Vector embedding generation
   - Graph construction

3. **Query Processing**
   - Natural language query parsing
   - Hybrid search (combining graph traversal and vector similarity)
   - Result ranking and aggregation

## Technology Stack

- **Graph Database**: Kuzu (OpenCypher compatible)
- **Vector Storage**: Integrated with Kuzu
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js
- **ML/AI**: Transformer-based models for embeddings and semantic analysis

## Key Design Principles

1. **Accuracy and Authenticity** - Prioritize scholarly accuracy in all data and relationships
2. **Performance** - Optimize for fast query response, even with complex graph traversals
3. **Scalability** - Design to handle growing data and user base
4. **Flexibility** - Support multiple query paradigms (graph, vector, hybrid)
