# API Reference

The Quran Knowledge Graph provides a comprehensive API for interacting with the graph database, performing queries, and leveraging the semantic capabilities of the system. This reference documentation will help you understand and use the API effectively.

## API Overview

The API is organized into several main components:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Graph API" icon="diagram-project" href="/api-reference/graph/overview">
    Access and query the graph structure, including nodes and relationships
  </Card>
  <Card title="Embedding API" icon="vector-square" href="/api-reference/embedding/overview">
    Generate and search vector embeddings for semantic analysis
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Getting Started with the API

### Installation

To use the API in your Python project:

```bash
pip install quran-knowledge-graph
```

### Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of using the API:

```python
from quran_graph.api import QuranGraphAPI

# Initialize the API
api = QuranGraphAPI()

# Get a verse by key
verse = api.get_verse("1:1")
print(verse)

# Perform a semantic search
results = api.semantic_search("guidance for humanity")
for result in results:
    print(f"{result.verse_key}: {result.text} (Similarity: {result.similarity:.2f})")
```

## Authentication

Currently, the API is designed for local use and does not require authentication. If you're integrating with a hosted version of the API, authentication details will be provided separately.

## Rate Limits

When using the API locally, there are no rate limits. However, be mindful of resource usage, especially for computationally intensive operations like semantic search or large graph traversals.

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes and returns detailed error messages. Common errors include:

- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid parameters or request format
- `404 Not Found`: Requested resource not found
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Server-side error

Example error response:

```json
{
  "error": "Resource not found",
  "message": "Verse with key '1:8' does not exist",
  "code": "verse_not_found"
}
```

## API Versioning

The API follows semantic versioning. The current version is v1.0.0. Breaking changes will be introduced with a new major version number.
