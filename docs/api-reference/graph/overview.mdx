# Graph API Overview

The Graph API provides access to the core functionality of the Quran Knowledge Graph, allowing you to query nodes, traverse relationships, and explore the interconnected structure of the Quranic text.

## Key Concepts

Before diving into the API details, it's important to understand a few key concepts:

### Nodes

Nodes represent entities in the graph, such as:

- **Chapter**: Surahs of the Quran
- **Verse**: Individual verses (ayahs)
- **Word**: Words within verses
- **Root**: Linguistic roots of words
- **Topic**: Thematic elements
- **Translation**: Translations in different languages
- **Tafsir**: Exegetical commentaries

### Relationships

Relationships connect nodes and represent meaningful associations, such as:

- **CONTAINS**: Connects chapters to verses, verses to words
- **HAS_ROOT**: Connects words to their linguistic roots
- **ADDRESSES_TOPIC**: Connects verses to the topics they address
- **SIMILAR_TO**: Connects semantically similar verses
- **HAS_TRANSLATION**: Connects verses to their translations

### Properties

Both nodes and relationships can have properties that provide additional information:

- Chapter properties include name, revelation place, verse count
- Verse properties include text, verse number, embedding vector
- Relationship properties include relevance scores, positions

## API Structure

The Graph API is organized into several components:

### Node Operations

- Retrieve nodes by ID or properties
- Get node properties
- Find nodes by type and criteria

### Relationship Operations

- Traverse relationships between nodes
- Get relationship properties
- Find connected nodes

### Query Operations

- Execute Cypher queries
- Perform graph traversals
- Apply filters and aggregations

## Basic Usage

Here are some examples of using the Graph API:

### Get a Chapter

```python
from quran_graph.api import QuranGraphAPI

api = QuranGraphAPI()

# Get chapter by number
chapter = api.get_chapter(1)
print(f"Chapter: {chapter.name_english} ({chapter.name_arabic})")
print(f"Verses: {chapter.verses_count}")
```

### Get Verses in a Chapter

```python
# Get verses in a chapter
verses = api.get_verses_by_chapter(1)
for verse in verses:
    print(f"{verse.verse_key}: {verse.text_uthmani}")
```

### Find Topics Addressed in a Verse

```python
# Get topics addressed in a verse
topics = api.get_verse_topics("2:255")
for topic in topics:
    print(f"Topic: {topic.name}")
```

### Execute a Custom Cypher Query

```python
# Execute a custom Cypher query
query = """
MATCH (c:Chapter {chapter_number: $chapter_number})-[:CONTAINS]->(v:Verse)
WHERE v.verse_number <= 5
RETURN v.verse_key, v.text_uthmani
ORDER BY v.verse_number
"""
results = api.execute_query(query, {"chapter_number": 1})
for row in results:
    print(f"{row['v.verse_key']}: {row['v.text_uthmani']}")
```
