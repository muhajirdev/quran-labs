# Discover Images

This directory should contain images for the Discover sidebar cards. The following images are needed:

- `social-media.jpg` - Image related to social media addiction
- `peace.jpg` - Image representing finding peace in a chaotic world
- `productivity.jpg` - Image representing productivity and overcoming procrastination
- `research.jpg` - Image representing Quranic research
- `preservation.jpg` - Image representing Quran preservation
- `perspective.jpg` - Image representing shifting perspective

For now, the component uses gradient backgrounds as placeholders, but for production, you should add actual images here.
